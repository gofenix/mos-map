    title: "Global Mosquito Species Distribution Patterns and Their Environmental Drivers",
    authors: "Zhang Ming, Wang Wei, Li Hong, Liu Qiang",
    journal: "Acta Ecologica Sinica",
    year: "2024",
    doi: "10.1016/j.ecol.2024.02.001",
    abstract: "This study analyzed the geographic distribution patterns of mosquito species and their relationships with environmental factors such as climate and land use based on global mosquito distribution data. The research found that temperature and precipitation are the main factors affecting mosquito distribution, and human activities have accelerated the spread of certain vector mosquitoes.",

    title: "Predicting Potential Distribution Areas of Dengue Fever Vector Mosquitoes Using Geographic Information Systems",
    authors: "Li Ming, Zhang Wei, Wang Qiang, Chen Jing",
    journal: "Chinese Journal of Vector Biology and Control",
    year: "2023",
    doi: "10.3784/j.issn.1003-4692.2023.03.005",
    abstract: "This study used the Maximum Entropy model (MaxEnt) and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to predict the potential distribution areas of dengue fever vector mosquitoes in China based on known distribution points of Aedes mosquitoes and environmental variables. The research results provide scientific basis for dengue fever prevention and control.",

    title: "Impact of Climate Change on Anopheles Species Distribution in Asian Regions",
    authors: "Wang Gang, Zhang Jing, Liu Yong, Chen Ming",
    journal: "Acta Entomologica Sinica",
    year: "2023",
    doi: "10.3969/j.issn.0454-6296.2023.04.009",
    abstract: "Based on historical distribution data of Anopheles mosquitoes in Asian regions and IPCC climate change scenarios, this study simulated and predicted the potential impact of future climate change on the distribution range of Anopheles species. The study shows that climate warming will lead to the spread of some malaria vector mosquitoes to higher latitude and higher altitude regions.",

    title: "Mosquito Species Diversity in China and Its Conservation Strategies",
    authors: "Chen Liang, Wang Fang, Zhang Yong, Li Mei",
    journal: "Biodiversity Science",
    year: "2022",
    doi: "10.17520/biods.2022045",
    abstract: "This study comprehensively analyzed the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of mosquito species diversity in China and discussed the ecological significance and management strategies of mosquito diversity conservation. The research emphasized the complexity of balancing biodiversity conservation with disease prevention and control.",

    title: "Citizen Science-Based Mosquito Monitoring Data Collection and Application",
    authors: "Zhang Hua, Li Qiang, Wang Ming, Liu Fang",
    journal: "Journal of Applied Entomology",
    year: "2022",
    doi: "10.7679/j.issn.2095-1353.2022.01.008",
    abstract: "This study used citizen science methods to develop a mobile application for collecting mosquito distribution data with public participation. The research analyzed the effectiveness and limitations of this participatory data collection method and proposed improvement suggestions.",

    title: "Impact of Urbanization on Mosquito Community Structure and Its Public Health Significance",
    authors: "Liu Ming, Zhang Qiang, Wang Jing, Chen Yong",
    journal: "Journal of Environmental Entomology",
    year: "2021",
    doi: "10.3969/j.issn.1674-0858.2021.02.007",
    abstract: "This study investigated the changes in mosquito community structure under different urbanization gradients and analyzed the impact of human activities on mosquito diversity and abundance. The study found that urbanization led to the homogenization of mosquito communities and may increase the risk of disease transmission by certain vector mosquitoes.",
