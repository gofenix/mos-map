# Global Distribution and Prevalence of Aedes aegypti: A Comprehensive Review

## Abstract
This study provides a comprehensive review of the global distribution of Aedes aegypti, analyzing the impact of climate change on its expanding range and potential threats to public health.

## Introduction
Aedes aegypti is a mosquito species known for transmitting several serious diseases, including dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika virus. Understanding its distribution patterns is crucial for public health planning and disease prevention strategies.

## Methods
We conducted a systematic review of published literature on the global distribution of Aedes aegypti from 1960 to 2024. Geographical data was compiled and analyzed using GIS techniques to create updated distribution maps.

## Results
Our analysis reveals significant expansion of Aedes aegypti into previously unaffected regions, particularly in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. Climate change appears to be a primary driver, with warming temperatures creating suitable habitats in previously inhospitable regions.

## Discussion
The expanding range of Aedes aegypti poses significant challenges for global health systems. Areas previously considered low-risk for aegypti-transmitted diseases now face new threats, necessitating adaptation of surveillance and control strategies.

## Conclusion
Our findings highlight the need for continued monitoring of Aedes aegypti populations globally and the implementation of adaptive management strategies to mitigate disease transmission risks in newly affected areas.
